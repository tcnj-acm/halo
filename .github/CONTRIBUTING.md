# Contribution Guide

Please read this document in its entirety.

## General

* Be nice and respectful of maintainers and contributors time and viewpoints
* Be as descriptive as possible! More info is always better than not enough
* Be patient, there may be a lot of in-flight work even across projects
* Have fun!

## Contributing

Contributing comes in many forms! We're incredibly grateful to anyone who can do any of the following:

* Add new features
* Fix bugs
* Fix typos
* Improve docs
* Triage issues
* Review pull requests
* Share opinions and viewpoints on issues

## Issues

* Before opening a new issue, check for existing issues that are related including closed ones
* Provide as much information as possible about the issue, how to reproduce the problem, and the expected behavior
* Don't needlessly bump issues

## Pull Requests

* Pull Requests should be accompanied first by an issue describing the reason a PR may be needed
* Don't make unrelated changes in your Pull Requests
* Pull Requests should be as small as possible
* Don't open a Pull Request if you don't plan to see it through, PRs submitted by individuals that cannot complete additional work to get a PR merged may have it closed
* Adhere to the existing code style of the repo, even if it differs from your personal preference
* When applicable, add tests that provide ample coverage of the logic added or changed
* Pull Requests should come from branches and never the default `main` or `master` branch
* When applicable, pull requests must pass CI including linting and testing
* Pull Requests must go through code review before they can be merged to the main branch
* Do not include "version bump" changes in the same PR as your code changes, these will be handled as a separate PR and releasing process
* Be as descriptive as possible in your PR description as to why these changes are being made and what the changes contain
* Make sure the `Allow edits from maintainers` checkbox is checked. That way we can make certain minor changes myself, allowing your pull request to be merged sooner.
